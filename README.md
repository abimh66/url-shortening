## Overview

### About The Project

This project is a landing page for a URL Shortening API. It allows users to shorten long URLs, view a list of their shortened URLs, and copy them to the clipboard. The design and functionality are based on a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

The main challenge was to create a fully responsive landing page that integrates with a URL shortening API to provide a seamless user experience. The page needed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
